       The future of coding is hard to predict, but we think there are three aspects that will remain the same regardless of model intelligence.,
       
              1. People will use AI to locate code,
       
              2. People will use AI to edit code,
       
              3. People will valide the changes that AI makes.,
       
              Current tools like Copilot and Cursor help with editing code, but (largely) not locating it or validating it. Here are some ideas on solving this,
       
              AI traces Finetune models to group code by feature, eg. "Here is the code for authentication". One can imagine breaking any program into fewer than ~100 features that any human can understand.,
       
              Allow AI to trace through deeply nested function calls and summarize the results.,
       
              Allow AI to write test cases and iterate until all of them pass.,
       
              One can generalize this to an AI that can iterate on higher-level test cases, like "create a good looking website".,
       
              (this is the feature idea, but used to describe changes) As AI makes larger code changes, humans will need more efficient ways to understand those changes. One idea is to group all changes into high level categories like "auth changes" or "state changes", and map each category back to the sourcecode.,
